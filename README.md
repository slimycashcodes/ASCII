# ASCII Projects Collection

This repository contains fun alternations of the same core project, experimenting with ASCII art, computer graphics, and video processing.  
Both projects involve concepts like **OpenCV**, **matrices**, **vectors**, and real-time rendering.

## ðŸš€ Projects

### 1. ASCII Rotating Donut
- A terminal-based rendering of a 3D rotating donut using ASCII characters.
- Explores concepts of **3D projections**, **sine/cosine transformations**, and **matrix operations**.
- Inspired by the legendary "ASCII donut".

**Features:**
- Pure ASCII rendering in terminal.
- Real-time rotation using math (no external 3D engine).
- Adjustable frame rate & resolution.

**Run:**
```bash
python ascii_donut.py

**TL;DR:** Put it in `README.md` with sections like **overview**, **projects**, **tech stack**, **concepts**, **demo**, **future work**. Keeps it clean and professional.  

Want me to also create a **fancy ASCII-style banner** at the top of the README (like `"ASCII PROJECTS"`) to make it pop?
