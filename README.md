# ASCII Projects Collection

This repository contains fun alternations of the same core project, experimenting with ASCII art, computer graphics, and video processing.  
Both projects involve concepts like **OpenCV**, **matrices**, **vectors**, and real-time rendering.

## ðŸš€ Projects

### 1. ASCII Rotating Donut
- A terminal-based rendering of a 3D rotating donut using ASCII characters.
- Explores concepts of **3D projections**, **sine/cosine transformations**, and **matrix operations**.
- Inspired by the legendary "ASCII donut".

**Features:**
- Pure ASCII rendering in terminal.
- Real-time rotation using math (no external 3D engine).
- Adjustable frame rate & resolution.

**Run:**
```bash
python ascii_donut.py
```
# 2. ASCII Video Converter

Convert your favorite videos into ASCII art!  
This project takes a video file, processes it frame by frame, and displays it as ASCII characters in real time.  
It combines **OpenCV**, **NumPy**, and ASCII density mapping to create a retro digital art effect.

---

## Features
- Supports common video formats (`.mp4`, `.avi`, etc.).
- Frame-by-frame video playback in ASCII.
- Adjustable ASCII density (character set & resolution).
- Option to **save frames** as `.txt` for later use.
- Lightweight, works directly in the terminal.

## Installation
Clone the repo and install the requirements:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ascii-video-converter.git
cd ascii-video-converter
pip install -r requirements.txt
